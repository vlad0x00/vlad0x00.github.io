Title: Interviewing friends and family

Here I'm referring to a podcast-like interview where you get to ask your friends and family questions you would not ask otherwise.

So far, I've done this with three friends and it was quite a bonding experience with each one of them. At this point, I know these people for 21, 12, and 11 years and yet coming up with questions to ask was not only not hard, I had to limit myself lest the interview would take the whole day!

The plan is now to interview my parents, which in some sense is the most important interview of all. Time with parents is limited. Very limited once you're an adult. And perhaps it's just me, but I don't have a habit of asking my parents deep questions about their life and most of what I know is what they've told me of their own accord.

Based on the interviews so far...  
1. Recording the interviews is basically a must, unless the interviewee prefers otherwise. Ask for permission to record, silly. Anyway, If you go at any real length, you'll absolutely forget a lot of details of the answers you've been given. It should also go without saying that these recordings are something to cherish. I keep the recording private and only share them with the interviewee.  
2. I'd advise against giving too much of your own opinions on the questions you ask. It easily turns into a discussion that centers on things external to the interviewee. The point here is to understand the interviewee, and in the context of your relationship. Deep discussions about other points should be had separately, except for letting the interviewee express their view as deeply as they desire.

As in a podcast, you should come up with the questions tailored to the person you're interviewing. Nonetheless, between the people I've interviewed, some questions were fundamental enough that it was only sensible to ask them to everyone. E.g. roughly in this order:  
1. **"Tell me about yourself from the beginning, where are you from, what was your childhood like, favourite childhood memory, etc."**  
I'd ask this even if you know the person since you were kids. I wouldn't dwell for _too_ long on this question this early, though. And for some people, these can be sensitive topics.  
2. I like to proceed here with lighthearted questions, e.g.: **"What's your favourite childhood video game, current or all time favourite music band, cats or dogs or frogs or snakes or... "** anyway  
If the person professionally works in, say, video games or music, it's not a bad idea to explore these topics deeper at this point.  
3. **"How would you describe your aesthetic?"**  
4. **"Who are your role models and what do you admire in them? How did they change over time? Who were the role models before, why are they no longer, and who are the role models now?"**  
5. **"What social cause do you care about and/or want to contribute to?"**  
6. **"Of all the things you've accomplished so far, what are you most proud of?"**  
7. **"Did you have a moment in life where you felt blissful, like everything is as it should be?"**  
8. **"What's your most controversial opinion you're willing to share right now?"**  
9. And the job-interview-like question: **"How do you see your life in the next year, five years, and ten years?"**

These questions alone can lead you down a long conversation, but as you can see, none of them are specific to a person. I highly recommend sprinkling in customized questions too.

Happy interviewing! I'll be back with more insights as I conduct more of these.

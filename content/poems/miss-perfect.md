Title: Miss Perfect
Date: 2024-05-16

Miss perfect will not be hurt.  
Her walls are impenetrable and  
her castle stands proud.  
She doesn't need anybody,  
and especially not you.  

In fact, she doesn't need you  
so much she'll hint at it all  
the time. Now why does she keep  
giving me a sad smile. A sad  
smile that yearns for comfort.  

Despite her disdain for me,  
her hug was a second too long.  
Despite her indifference, she'll bid  
for a second of attention.  

Her tall fortress is flooding with  
tears inside. Yet another burst pipe,  
but they come as a surprise every  
time. How long can these walls last,  
anyway.

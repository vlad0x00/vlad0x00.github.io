Title: The classy dissenter
Date: 2023-02-24

Of rebel nation far 'way born  
in eyes of foe as bleeding thorn  
To ones in need she gave her faith  
and clean of blood a promised slate  

Her heart divided parts in two  
There's riches waiting for pursuit!  
But pull is strong to grace and art  
and so her worlds are torn apart  

A cold embrace to her: unknown  
Her motives fathoms she alone  
A flirt that piques eyes all around  
but in her wake oh she confounds  

Her fate forever seems unclear  
but strength of spirit always near  
No life is one she'd dare regret  
nor any lovely soul she's met

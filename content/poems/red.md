Title: Red
Date: 2023-12-27

There's a strange calmness to red.  
She meticulously hides her fire,  
but fans the flames when time is right.  
  
Red is odd, but familiar. She's the feeling  
of being lost, and then finding out exactly  
where you are. Feeling glad you're in  
safe territory.  

Safe! But not without a surprise. She  
keeps you on your toes and gives you  
a sly smile.  
You thought you were in control?  
Think again.  
  
If you feel a moment of coldness,  
rest assured you're about to be gasping for air  
while she melts you in her cauldron.  
  
At loss of words? Yet you can't say enough.  
Red will ensure your contradictions surface  
and she'll be there to enjoy it.

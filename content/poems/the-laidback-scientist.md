Title: The laidback scientist
Date: 2022-12-27

Worries plagued all of us. A chilling fear  
touched everyone's heart, leaving them uneasy.  
Except for him. Can anybody say they saw  
him flinch, in face of danger, toil, and life?  

With camaraderie and warmth are blessed  
the lucky ones who know him. Caring soul  
enclosed in a rock hard shell, one emotion  
would never dare emerge from, unprotected.  

On to new adventures he goes forth now,  
with sense of humour and ambition armed,  
where new connections eagerly await  
arrival of the laidback scientist.

            <p>Today, OpenAI revealed <a href="https://openai.com/sora">Sora</a>, the text to video <span class="caps">AI</span> which is mindblowingly impressive. The advances in <span class="caps">AI</span> art pose the question on how much it makes sense for a human to be in control when making images, videos, or perhaps poems, since ChatGPT is capable of writing&nbsp;those.</p>
<p>A simple way to divide artistic projects is along the aesthetic value axis and the expression axis. The subjectiveness of aesthetics is not relevant here, since the following applies from anybody&#8217;s perspective. The <span class="caps">AI</span> is optimizing for aesthetic value and it&#8217;s capable of producing highly aesthetic pieces in no time. The expression axis, though, is only relevant if you care about <span class="caps">AI</span>&#8217;s creative decisions. Most people at the time of writing of this article don&#8217;t, and conversely, people care about the expression of an artist, and especially of somebody dear to them. I&#8217;ve received gifts that were art pieces and the threshold after which quality of such an art piece becomes irrelevant is very low. What&#8217;s really the only factor is the expression, thought, care, and the details behind the piece. I cherish those as they&#8217;re all associated with the gift&nbsp;giver.</p>
<p>Similarly, when producing an art piece and given the choice to use <span class="caps">AI</span>, you have a trade-off. If you want to maximize capturing your artistic vision, you&#8217;d want to minimize outsourcing creative decision-making to <span class="caps">AI</span>. At the extreme of this, the <span class="caps">AI</span> is a small assistant helping your brush strokes, but gets no further say. If you&#8217;re writing a poem to express your emotions and qualia, to have the <span class="caps">AI</span> convey it fully, you&#8217;d need to describe this in immense detail at which the prompt itself is the poem, anyway. The <span class="caps">AI</span> might help choose words for aesthetic value or if you can&#8217;t think of the right words, but this is a helping hand you don&#8217;t need a particularly powerful <span class="caps">AI</span>&nbsp;for.</p>
<p>None of this is criticism of <span class="caps">AI</span> art. It just points to an axis orthogonal to what <span class="caps">AI</span> can optimize&nbsp;for.</p>
